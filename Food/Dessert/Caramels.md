Source: Betty Crocker Cookbook, ISBN 978-0-544-64892-0

## Ingredients
* 2 cups sugar
* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 2 cups whipping cream
* 3/4 cups light corn syrup

## Directions
1. Line 8" or 9" square pan with foil, leaving 1 inch of foil hanging over 2 opposite sides of pan; grease foil with butter.
2. In 3-quart saucepan, heat all ingredients to boiling over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil uncovered for about 35 minutes, stirring frequently, to 245Â°F on candy thermometer or until small amount of mixture dropped into cup of very cold water forms a firm ball that holds its shape until pressed. Immediately spread in pan. Cool completely, about 2 hours.
3. Using foil, lift caramels out of pan; place on cutting board. Peel foil from caramels. Cut into squares, 8 rows by 8 rows. Optionally, wrap each piece individually.
