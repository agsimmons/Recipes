Source: Betty Crocker Cookbook, ISBN 978-0-544-64892-0

## Ingredients
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp water
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1.5 cups sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup light corn syrup
* 3 tbsp butter, cut into pieces

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 200°F. Grease 2 (15"x10"x1") pans with butter; keep warm in oven. (Keeping the pans warm allows the candy to be spread 1/4 inch thick without it setting up.) Grease long metal spatula with butter; set aside.

2. In small bowl, mix baking soda, 1 tsp water, and the vanilla; set aside. In 3-quart saucepan, mix sugar, 1 cup water, and the corn syrup. Cook over medium heat about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, to 240°F on candy thermometer or until small amount of mixture dropped into cup of very cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from water.

3. Stir in butter and peanuts. Cook over medium heat about 13 minutes, stirring constantly, to 300°F or until small amount of mixture dropped into cup of very cold water separates into hard, brittle threads. (Watch carefully so mixture does not burn.) Immediatly remove from heat. Quickly stir in baking soda mixture until light and foamy.

4. Pour half of the mixture onto each cookie sheet and quickly spread about 1/4 inch thick with buttered spatula. Cool completely, at least 1 hour. Break into pieces. Store in tightly covered container at least 2 weeks.
